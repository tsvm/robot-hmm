This is an implementation of the project for the "Estimation and Classification" course at Instituto de Telecomunicações. 

The implementation is in Python.

The required libraries are: numpy, tkinter.



The project contains the following files:

* hmm.py - contains implementation of the forward algorithm and preparation of the hidden and observed possible states from the given game setup.

* robot.py - contains implementation of the possible moves of the robot in the grid.

* grid.py - contains functions for checking allowed states in the grid.

* play.py - prepares and simulates the robot movement. This is the starting point of the project. It contains implementation of the grphical project interface and the code for simulation of the robot movement and displaying of the possible positions.




In order to start the simulation, execute the file `play.py`:

``` python play.py ```
